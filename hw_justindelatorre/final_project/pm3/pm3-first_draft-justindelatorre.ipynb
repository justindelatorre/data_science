      "'WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS  JANUARY 20, 1997    My fellow citizens:  At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.  It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs--a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come.  We must keep our old democracy forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.  The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal.  It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.  Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.  And what a century it has been.  America became the world\\'s mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.  Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.  Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose.  We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast.  We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency.  Those choices made all the difference. At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union.  When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today.  We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.  In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the world\\'s indispensable nation. Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth.  Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment. Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.  And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government.  Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We--the American people--we are the solution.  Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.  As times change, so government must change.  We need a new government for a new century--humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less.  Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less.  The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity--not a guarantee, but a real opportunity--to build better lives.  Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship.  And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century.  There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do:  teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.  Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility--not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation.  Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.  The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future--will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?  Will we all come together, or come apart?  The divide of race has been America\\'s constant curse. And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different.  These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past.  They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror.  And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.  These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere.  We shall overcome them. And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.  Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century.  Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.  As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines. Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren. Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.  The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries.  Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.  My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy?  To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding \"Yes.\"  This is the heart of our task.  With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America\\'s journey.  The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.  In this new land, education will be every citizen\\'s most prized possession.  Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy.  And the doors of higher education will be open to all.  The knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child.  Parents and children will have time not only to work, but to read and play together.  And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.  Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who can work, will work, with today\\'s permanent under class part of tomorrow\\'s growing middle class.  New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and hardworking families too long denied.  We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction.  Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas. And the world\\'s greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.  Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations--a nation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its values. A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time.  A nation that fortifies the world\\'s most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.  And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests--regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.  Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens.  Prosperity and power--yes, they are important, and we must maintain them.  But let us never forget:  The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart.  In the end, all the world\\'s wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.  Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation.  Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart.  Martin Luther King\\'s dream was the American Dream.  His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed.  Our history has been built on such dreams and labors.  And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.  To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office. I ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another.  Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.  No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with America\\'s mission.  America demands and deserves big things from us--and nothing big ever came from being small.  Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing the end of his own life.  He said:  \"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and division.\"  Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For all of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end.  But the journey of our America must go on.  And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare. The demands of our time are great and they are different.  Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy heart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history. Yes, let us build our bridge.  A bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise.  May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the American promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people; with America\\'s bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world.  From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth.  May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead--and always, always bless our America.'\n"

      "[('GEORGE WASHINGTON, FIRST INAUGURAL',\n",
      "  'Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:  Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years--a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in executing this task, I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated.  Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence.  By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the President \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained; and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.  Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good; for I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard  for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.  To the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honored with a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed; and being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department, and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.  Having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the Human Race in humble supplication that, since He has been pleased to favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity, and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness, so His divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.')]\n"

      "'\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\\r\\n\\r\\nI embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents\\r\\nitself of congratulating you on the present favorable prospects of our\\r\\npublic affairs. The recent accession of the important state of North\\r\\nCarolina to the Constitution of the United States (of which official\\r\\ninformation has been received), the rising credit and respectability of\\r\\nour country, the general and increasing good will toward the government\\r\\nof the Union, and the concord, peace, and plenty with which we are\\r\\nblessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our\\r\\nnational prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but\\r\\nderive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last\\r\\nsession have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty\\r\\nand difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize\\r\\ntheir expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious\\r\\nProvidence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present\\r\\nimportant session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your\\r\\npatriotism, firmness, and wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that\\r\\nof providing for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be\\r\\nprepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nA free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end\\r\\na uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and\\r\\ninterest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to\\r\\nrender them independent of others for essential, particularly military,\\r\\nsupplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable\\r\\nwill be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may\\r\\nbe made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the\\r\\ncomfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to\\r\\neconomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard\\r\\nto certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants\\r\\nof our southern and western frontiers from their depredations, but you\\r\\nwill perceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall\\r\\ndirect to be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the\\r\\nCommonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford\\r\\nprotection to those parts of the Union, and, if necessary, to punish\\r\\naggressors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interests of the United States require that our intercourse with\\r\\nother nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me\\r\\nto fulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may\\r\\nrender most conducive to the public good, and to this end that the\\r\\ncompensation to be made to the persons who may be employed should,\\r\\naccording to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law, and a\\r\\ncompetent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the\\r\\nconduct of foreign affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which\\r\\nforeigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily\\r\\nascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States\\r\\nis an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly\\r\\nattended to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper\\r\\nmeans will not, I trust, need recommendation; but I can not forbear\\r\\nintimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as\\r\\nwell to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to\\r\\nthe exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of\\r\\nfacilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by\\r\\na due attention to the post-office and post-roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that\\r\\nthere is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the\\r\\npromotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the\\r\\nsurest basis of public happiness. In one in which the measures of\\r\\ngovernment receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of\\r\\nthe community as in ours it is proportionably essential.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the security of a free constitution it contributes in various\\r\\nways--by convincing those who are intrusted with the public\\r\\nadministration that every valuable end of government is best answered by\\r\\nthe enlightened confidence of the people, and by teaching the people\\r\\nthemselves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide\\r\\nagainst invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the\\r\\nnecessary exercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from\\r\\na disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable\\r\\nexigencies of society; to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that\\r\\nof licentiousness-- cherishing the first, avoiding the last--and uniting\\r\\na speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments, with an\\r\\ninviolable respect to the laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to\\r\\nseminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a\\r\\nnational university, or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a\\r\\nplace in the deliberations of the legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the\\r\\nresolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an\\r\\nadequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of\\r\\nhigh importance to the national honor and prosperity. In this sentiment\\r\\nI entirely concur; and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to\\r\\ndevise such a provision as will be truly with the end I add an equal\\r\\nreliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the\\r\\nlegislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the\\r\\ncharacter and interests of the United States are so obviously so deeply\\r\\nconcerned, and which has received so explicit a sanction from your\\r\\ndeclaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nGentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have directed the proper officers to lay before you, respectively,\\r\\nsuch papers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended\\r\\nto your consideration, and necessary to convey to you that information\\r\\nof the state of the Union which it is my duty to afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and\\r\\nefforts ought to be directed, and I shall derive great satisfaction from\\r\\na cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring\\r\\nto our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect\\r\\nfrom a free, efficient, and equal government.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n"
