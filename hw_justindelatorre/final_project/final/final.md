###Problem Statement
The initial objective of this project was to determine how politically liberal or conservative and president was based on text from his inaugural addresses and State of the Union speeches. Over time, however, I realized that this would be difficult due to time restrictions and the lack of an existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) package that could map liberal or conservative sentiment.

After going through a few stages of data wrangling and training and testing unsuccessful models, I eventually decided to focus on training and testing a model that could accurately classify both a president's religious and political affiliation, again based on speech text.

###Obtaining the Data
Both the inaugural address and State of the Union speech text were downloaded as <code>.txt</code> files from Project Gutenberg:
[Inaugural Addresses](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/925/pg925.txt)
[States of the Union](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5050/pg5050.txt)
